# StackerAJAX

In this assignment from Thinkful, I built the first feature for StackOverflow Reputation builder. The code allows users to submit a topic theyâ€™re interested in and then display results of these queries using AJAX to interact with the StackExchange API.

The second feature gave users the ability to search for the top StackOverflow answerers for particular topics by adding code to app.js that handles user requests for inspiration.

To clarify, the requirements for this feature were:
Users can submit a topic they want to find top answerers for on Stack Overflow.
The app makes an AJAX call to the appropriate endpoint on the StackExchange API.
The DOM is updated with information about top answerers (if any) after the response is returned.
